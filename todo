[ ] CryptbinC

[ ] See FG eyes


--- m:

[ ] Finish ArgParser work (paper 54)

[ ] Fix stub_tools/binhide_facade.py - remove c2.* deps cuz it's called from VS GUI where there is no special %PATH%

[ ] Draft ProtoGraphGenerator (cuz fgconf is transmitted that way)

[ ] Add StageRunnerExecutor (cuz need to see stage graphs when debugging FuncGen)


problems
  !#FIRE reskit/res_add W=H
  !#Security ScenarioBuilder: solution name in shell command
  !#Optimization remove TLS code if no TLS (wrap #ifdef)

generic todo
  cpp_parts everywhere zvars, not staticvars

fg LOOK IDA
  add _fk() to cpp_parts everywhere, in particular, randomize AllocationSize

ae
  aedecay - show GUI if emulated - draft
  indirect use of ae values, mix with fake ae - make emu updates harder
  [see bh] windef emulator linux - doesn't work, too old, refactor their code
  mexec tool to execute on win7, etc.
  ;blur ;gl ;speed/complexity ;single/multi entry points ;write somewhere, read in another place

trasher
  fire: apis never repeat (1api=1call)
  fire: apis not mixed; but it's cool; maybe mix them but not randomly, humanly

PROGGEN PLAN + MINIMUM WEAPON FUNCTIONALITY + OTHER FUNCTIONALITY LATER 
  >INTEGRATING PG (continue: run pg.py, +continue output_gen.py)
    !integrate crafted 8-thread static FG, then rewrite to automatic
  Shuffle usercodes
  Acts (cocrel, etc.)
  Wakers
  Fake Events, semas, mutexes, waitable timers
  PMGenerator instead of hardcoded PM
